I propose using the character "S" to represent a knight, instead of the
more or less conventional "N", so that we can implement alternate variants of
chess with Nightriders.

If you will be working with my API I recommend reading up on chess algebraic
notation. I will base my API on it.


To Yi:

Please create seperate constructors for each piece. The only difference between
them should be the int they take, 1 being a white pawn, -1 a black pawn, etc.
etc.

0 denotes an empty square.

When I create the board I will want to pass the position of my created pieces
to an array in your methods. This will allow for more instantaneous access,
since instead of iterating over the entire board we will only need to check
a single array of pieces, and move thier locations to the board. Please create
an API for that.
